            <p>
            Growing up in a small town called Albemarle, North Carolina, I always had big dreams for myself. I worked hard in school and participated in many extra-curricular activities, such as dance, piano lessons, and cheerleading. For my undergraduate degree I attended my dream school, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I received my Bachelor's of Arts in Mass Communication with a concentration in Media Production. All my life I wanted to be a performer, so following graduation from UNC, I moved to Orlando, Florida to perform at the Walt Disney World Resort. Although the pandemic cut my time as a performer short, I am so grateful to now be working towards my master's degree online through the University of Florida. I have always been very creative and artistic in everything I did, and I am so happy to now have the opportunity to put that creativity to action in a digital format. When I am not focusing on school work, you can find me teaching dance classes on the side, and snuggling my dog, Pepper, with any chance I get!
